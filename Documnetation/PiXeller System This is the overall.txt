PiXeller System: This is the overall system that encompasses the entire PiXeller application. It represents the entire ecosystem of PiXeller.

PiXeller Application: This component represents the main application of PiXeller. It contains different modules or services that work together to provide the desired functionality.

User Interface: This module represents the user interface of the PiXeller application. It includes the components responsible for presenting the application to users, such as web pages, mobile app screens, and user interaction elements.

Authentication Service: This component provides authentication functionality for the PiXeller application. It handles user authentication, registration, and manages user sessions.

API Gateway: The API Gateway acts as an intermediary between the User Interface and the Data Services. It provides a unified entry point for clients to access the PiXeller API. It can handle authentication, request routing, and other cross-cutting concerns.

Data Services (Database): This component represents the data services or databases used by the PiXeller application. It stores and manages the application's data, including user information, product listings, bidding data, and other relevant data.

External Systems: This part represents any external systems or services that are integrated with the PiXeller application. These could include payment gateways, third-party APIs, messaging services, or any other systems that provide additional functionality or data exchange.

The diagram shows the relationships and interactions between the different components in the PiXeller system. The User Interface communicates with the Authentication Service for user authentication and session management. The API Gateway acts as a gateway to the underlying Data Services, allowing the User Interface to make requests and retrieve or update data from the database. External Systems may interact with the PiXeller application through APIs or other integration mechanisms.

This system architecture provides a high-level view of how the different components and services in PiXeller are organized and interact with each other to deliver the desired functionality to users.
